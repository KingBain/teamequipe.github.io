			<h2>What is Folding?</h2>
			<blockquote cite="https://foldingathome.org/about/">
				<p>"Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a distributed computing project for simulating protein dynamics, including the process of protein folding and the movements of proteins implicated in a variety of diseases. It brings together citizen scientists who volunteer to run simulations of protein dynamics on their personal computers. Insights from this data are helping scientists to better understand biology, and providing new opportunities for developing therapeutics." </p>

			<h2>How does folding Help Tackle COVID-19?</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"<a href="https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/">Downloading Folding@home</a> and helping us run simulations is the primary way to contribute. These calculations are enormous and every little bit helps! Each simulation you run is like buying a lottery ticket. The more tickets we buy, the better our chances of hitting the jackpot." </p>

				<li>Learn about "<a href="https://foldingathome.org/2020/03/30/covid-19-free-energy-calculations/">protein folding</a>" for COVID-19</li>
				<li>Start by <a href="https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/">downloading the folding software</a></li>
				<li>Learn how to <a href="https://foldingathome.org/support/faq/installation-guides/">install and configure</a></li>
				<li>Then join the <a href="https://stats.foldingathome.org/team/247377">Team Equipe GOC #247377</a> team</li>

			<h2>Tips for Managing Resources Between Working and Folding</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Experiment with the POWER and WHEN settings the fit your situation best.</li>
				<li>For the least hastle and best performance set the client to "Full Power" and "Only when Idle"</li>
				<li>Leave you computer running even when you are not using it but turn the monitors off. This will decrease energy consumption.</li>
				<li>Turn off any screen savers you might have, this frees up more compute power for Folding.</li>
				<li>If you are going to be leaving your computer for a long time set the client to "Full Power" and "while I am working"</li>
				<li>If you are starting your workday and worried about competing resources you can choose "Stop Folding", but consider the option to "Finish up folding, then stop". This works well if you have 30 min left of folding to finsih the Work Unit.</li>
				<li>In the client note the "My computer has X days to complete this work unit". If you shutdown or stop folding, X is the length of time you have to complete the work unit. If you miss this cut off, you might not get the points and the job will be passed to someone else.</li>
